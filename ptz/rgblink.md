# RGBLink
## Direct Connection
connect both the camera and your computer to a switch (hence, a router will work too)
now, set the address resolution of your client to "Manual" and use an IP in the same subnet as the RGBLink camera (the IP is printed on startup)
in order to connect to the camera, create a static route for the camera subnet
